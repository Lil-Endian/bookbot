# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

It can parse plain text books in .txt files on your file system.
Simply pass the relative path of the .txt file in as the second argument to analyse the text.
This script will report:
    1. the filepath to the .txt file
    2. the total word count
    3. the occurences of each letter in the text, sorted from most common to least common

It VVorks!
